A rough Wordle solver

When Wordle became a thing, my immediate reaction was "This looks like work; I should just have a commputer solve it". There have subsequently been much more rigorous solvers developed (including by the NYTimes), but this works well for a quick effort. 

The wordfile (available guesses) is from Linux `words`, filtered for 5 letter examples.
